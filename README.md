# Madrid Pollution Data Science Assessment - Indigitall Interview

## Overview

This project serves as a personal assessment for an interview with indigitall. The primary focus is to evaluate my programming style, problem-solving skills, and the ability to present results and justify decisions.

## Problem Statement

### Objective
The objective of this assessment is to showcase my programming style, problem-solving approach, and the ability to effectively communicate and justify decisions.

### Scope
The assessment is intentionally open-ended, allowing flexibility in deciding the depth of completion. The goal is to cover the basics, provide commentary on potential improvements, and suggest next steps without necessarily implementing them.

### Delivery
The programming is to be done in Python 3, with the output format facilitating the inclusion of text, code, and output. The deliverable can be submitted in one of the following formats:
- As a zip file containing the assessment.
- Uploaded to a repository accessible by the interviewers (e.g., a public GitHub repository).
- Utilizing Google Colab.

Regardless of the method chosen, the deliverable must be executable.

## Project Details

### Problem Description
The task involves storing NO2 air pollution level data for Madrid during the year 2018 in a custom database. The objective is to enable other departments to:
- Visualize pollution evolution through daily/monthly graphs, animated heat maps, etc.
- Conduct analyses of extraordinary situations, such as days with restrictions, and measure the effectiveness of certain measures.

The data is available on the Madrid Open Data portal [here](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=f3c0f7d512273410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default). The PDF documentation provided should be consulted for valuable insights into the dataset. Key considerations include:
- Downloading data specifically for the year 2018.
- Focusing solely on NO2 measurements; discarding measurements of other pollutants.
- Accessing information about measurement stations [here](https://gist.github.com/koldLight/533038c852ca0a546da247292b5d9ab9) if needed.
- Acquiring information about hourly temperatures in Madrid for 2018 [here](https://gist.github.com/koldLight/90577c60ad4267d4df490e6239cebf58).

### Objectives
1. **Data Handling:**
   - Read and clean the data, leaving it in a format comfortable for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis, extracting insights into factors influencing NO2 levels, such as seasonal and environmental factors.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Propose a model for predicting NO2 levels three days in advance. Implementation is optional, but I may choose to do so. Consider discussing:
     - Possible variables to include.
     - Historical data depth.
     - Modeling techniques to try.

## Deliverables

Include the relevant code, analysis, and any additional documentation in the deliverable. Ensure that it is well-organized and easy to follow.

Feel free to structure the project directory and code in a way that makes sense. Provide clear instructions on how to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.

**Looking forward to showcasing my skills in this assessment!**
